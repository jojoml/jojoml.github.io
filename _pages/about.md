I'm currently a Second Year PHD student at University of British Columbia, Vancouver, supervised by Professor [Lenoid Sigal](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lsigal/) and Professor [Renjie Liao](https://lrjconan.github.io/), My research interest lies in  Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

I received my B.Eng Degree in the Department of Computer Science at Huazhong University of Sci and Tech(HUST) in 2019. After that, I worked as a research assistant at MVIG lab, Shanghai Jiao Tong University(SJTU) from Sep.2019 to June.2020 under the super vision of [Prof. Cewu Lu (SJTU)](https://www.mvig.org/). I've also been worked closely with [Dr. Xiangyu Xu(NTU)](https://sites.google.com/view/xiangyuxu) & [Dr. wenxiu Sun(SenseTime)](http://wenxiusun.com/) during my internship at sensetime.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
